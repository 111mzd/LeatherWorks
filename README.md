Welcome to the Leather Works Git!

Leather Works is a mod (modification) for minecraft using forge.
Leather Works is the first in a series of mods designed to overhaul and expand on the various crafting areas in Minecraft. And designed to be a middle ground between semi-realism and simplicity to blend in to Vanilla Minecraft nicely.
